# What does the last line in the following code output?

dictionary = {'first': [1]}
num_list = dictionary['first']
num_list.append(2)

print(num_list)
print(dictionary)

# MY ANSWER: The last line prints {'first': [1]} because dictionary is not mutated
# during the program and the call to print(dictionary) will just print the unchanged
# dictionary variable value.

# LS ANSWER:
[1, 2]
{'first': [1, 2]}

# Since num_list is a reference to the original list in dictionary, appending to 
# num_list modifies the list. Thus, the original dictionary is also updated.

# If, instead of modifying the original dictionary, we want to modify num_list 
# but not dictionary, we have a couple of options:

# We can initialize num_list with a reference to a copy of the original list:

dictionary = {"first": [1]}
num_list = dictionary["first"].copy()
num_list.append(2)

# We can use list slicing which returns a new list:

dictionary = {"first": [1]}
num_list = dictionary["first"][:]
num_list.append(2)
